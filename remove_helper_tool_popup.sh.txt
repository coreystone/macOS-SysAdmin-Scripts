# This script solves an annoying popup that a lot of users receive: 
# "An update is ready to install. [app] is trying to add a new helper tool."
 
# This happens when /Applications/[app_path].app is owned by root, rather than the user. 
# Chown the app to directory to your user profile to undo root ownership.
# For example, Slack is a usual suspect
 
 
sudo chown -R %UserId%:staff /Applications/Slack.app
